            <h2>Week 1</h2>

            <p>
                This week was where i started my web development journey. I had no idea what was web development before hand and my 
                only experience with it was with <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">wix.com</a> to create a portfolio for my DSA.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the lessons, I learnt what was web development and the diffrent attributes with it such as the diffrence between a front-end and a back-end developer.
                I also learnt the basics of html and the most useful tags we can utilize. My lecturer also taught us some css so that we could create a table with borders.
                After these lessons, i fully understand what a web developer does and how to utilize html.

        <section id = "wk2">
            <h2>Week 2</h2>

            <p>After learning html last week, we were then taught how to use sematic html this week to organise our html code such that we 
                can identify sections easier. We learnt tags such as: 
            <ul>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>footer</li>
                <li>section</li>
                <li>nav</li>
                <li>article</li>
                <li>aside</li>
            </ul>
            and more!

            <p>
                We were then taught the basics of css and how to set up css into a website, <em id="wk2_colorex">color text</em>, 
                <em id="wk2_fontex">use fonts</em>, aglin text and customize <a href="">hyperlinks</a>.We also learnt how to create 
                <em>#special ids</em>, <strong>.classes</strong>> and use sematic HTML to specify styles to diffrent text and sections.
                 It was fun customizing websites to my hearts content and also learning new ways to shape websites to the wasy i liked. From this lessons, 
                 i learnt how to utilize css and html together so to customize my websites.

        </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>At the end, we learnt about css flex boxes (flexible boxes) which are boxes that move around according to the screen size. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <div id="flex_container_ex">

            </div>
            <br>

            <p>In this week, we learnt more about Javascript(js) and diffrent functions it can do. We recapped on last lesson's js basics and also
                learnt functions like for looping, strict equals(===) and not equals(!==) and arrays. We also learnt more on the DOM structure and 
                diffrent functions to access elements such as getelementsbyClassname() and getelementsbyID(). Overall, i feel with these lessons,
                i am able to fully utilize js in my websites to give them more functionality.

            <p>This week, we learnt about execption handling and validation in forms and inputs through Javascript. Using events, event listeners, event handlers, i can control
                the type of inputs that can be accepted by the website e.g. a username can only be 20 characters long. I also learnt the diffrent types of events that i can use
                to make a more interactive website.

                i am able to save diffrent items such as login information and form inputs that would stay inside the storage even if the webpage is
